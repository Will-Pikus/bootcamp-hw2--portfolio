# bootcamp-hw2-portfolio
### Description
Webpage is a portfolio of my work in bootcamp to display to showcase my work to employers.

The site is structured as follows:
1.Nav bar
2.Main header image
3.About me 
4.Projects
    a.The first project in HTML is styled larger then the rest
    b.Three other projects follow after
5.Contact me
6.Footer

Note* I am currently unable to get my "about me" section to wrap and siplay appropriate sizing when the browser window is changed. Due to time constraint I will be unable to fix this by 12/18. I plan to fix this by next class session 12/21.
